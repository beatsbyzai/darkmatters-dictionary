          <p class="authorstyle author134492 small">
            “The concept of dark matter might bring to mind opacity, the color black, limitlessness and the limitations imposed on blackness, the dark, anti-matter, that which is not optically available, black holes, the Big Bang theory, and other concerns of cosmology where dark matter is that nonluminous component of the universe that is said to exist but cannot be observed, cannot be re-created in laboratory conditions. Its distribution cannot be measured; its properties cannot be determined; and so it remains undetectable. The gravitational pull of this unseen matter is said to move galaxies. Invisible and unknowable, yet somehow still there, dark matter, in this planetary sense, is theoretical. If the term “dark matter” is a way to think about race, where race, as Howard Winant puts it, “remains the dark matter, the often invisible substance that in many ways structures the universe of modernity,” then one must ask here, invisible to whom? If it is often invisible, then how is it sensed, experienced, and lived? Is it really invisible, or is it rather unseen and unperceived by many? In her essay “Black (W)holes and the Geometry of Black Female Sexuality,” Evelyn Hammonds takes up the astrophysics of black holes found in Michele Wallace’s discussion of the negation of black creative genius to say that if “we can detect the presence of a black hole by its effects on the region of space where it is located,” where, unseen, its energy distorts and disrupts that around it, from that understanding we can then use this theorizing as a way to “develop reading strategies that allow us to make visible the distorting and productive effects” of black female sexualities in particular, and blackness in general.”

            Zoom is a video-conferencing platform that became extremely popular in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Within weeks many professional institutions and universities mandated the use of Zoom by employees rather than other more familiar video-conferencing platforms. Though applications such as Skype and FaceTime have built their names to be synonymous with the act of video-calling, Zoom immediately overcame their familiarity through mere ubiquity. Zoom’s popularity has raised privacy concerns for many critics of networked technology, and though the FBI issued a warning about Zoom’s teleconferences being hijacked to display violent imagery and hate speech, it is still considered a popular platform for mass video-conferencing in the United States as of August 2020.

We interact person to person on social media, watching and wondering about each other through likes and clicks. In ways that are both obvious and obfuscated from us, police and advertisers monitor our behaviors and connections using data that could follow us forever. By storing our memories online, we are trackable and traceable in an ever expanding spiral outwards, with all roads leading to profit.

            Colonialism is an aggressive predatory behavior in which colonized people are the victims of the extending practices of authority, selfishness, and cruelty of the colonizers. Colonialism also affects native people significantly as the colonizers occupy the land that does not belong to them as well as the negative impact of the ideology of imperialism to the descendants of indigenous people.

            I've been grappling with these same feelings too. I feel helpless and powerless. I'm skeptical that my impulse to make art or do something self-directed in this moment is not the kind of work that needs to be done.<BR>
